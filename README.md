A multi-page project using Bootstrap features

This project was developed through the Udemy course, "Learn to Build Beautiful HTML5 & CSS3 Websites in 1 Month".  This project utilized the Bootstrap framework and consists of multiple projects.  This project helped me to become more familiar with Bootstrap features and how to incorporate them into my projects, thus speeding up the development process.
